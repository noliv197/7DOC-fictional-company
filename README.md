## About The Project
The 7 days of code exercise is an Alura's initiative to put into practice all the learning achieved throughout the school's technology and programming training. 

## HTML-CSS
In the HTML-CSS category, the challenge is to develop a replica of a page from a Figma's layout.
The main focus of the exercises is to know how to:

* Analyze figma layout and arrange HTML accordingly
* Use Flexbox or Grid for layout responsiveness
* Use responsiveness units to manipulate images and font sizes

- Observations:
  - The focus of the exercise was using CSS, therefore I preferred to make the side menu with css instead of javascript. 
    - I used this [blog](http://lucasmaiaesilva.com.br/posts/criando-modal-simples-com-html-e-css/) for reference to create the modal menu
